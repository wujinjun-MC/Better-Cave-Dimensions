## Bug Fix
- [x] Some biomes are missing ([Upstream issue #9](https://github.com/klinbee/Better-Cave-Worlds/issues/9)) (Fixed by [my PR](https://github.com/klinbee/Better-Cave-Worlds/pull/10#event-19395656866))
- [ ] Some terrain generation can break bedrock roof (e.g. Cold biomes (bedrocks are replaced by snow blocks))
